# Ben Hollier's UI Library

Very unfinished/untested Go UI library. 
UI 'designs' are loaded as Android layout-style XML files, which are processed using an expandable element/attribute system.
The project currently uses [pixel](https://github.com/faiface/pixel) for renderering.
At present there are 7 built-in UI elements:

+ LinearLayout
+ GridLayout
+ RelativeLayout
+ ImageButton
+ TextButton
+ Image
+ Import

More elements + proper documentation coming soon!
